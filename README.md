# Nuxt 2 with Express

> [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) + [Nuxt 2](https://v2.nuxt.com) = :zap:

Live Demo: [https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nuxt-community/express-template](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nuxt-community/express-template)

## Nuxt 3

Nuxt 3 is powered by [unjs/h3](https://github.com/unjs/h3) which has a compatible API with Express and is much faster with the ability to run in Workers ([read more about it](https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge)).

This is why this template won't be migrated to Nuxt 3.

## Installation

This is a template project, click on the green button "Use this template" at the top of this page and get started with GitHub :sparkles:

One you cloned your repository, install the dependencies with:

```bash
yarn install # or npm install
```

## ExpressJS Changes

- There is a  `api` directory with the root of your `api` server.
- The `routes` directory is called `api/routes`.
